  Version 0.3.0

  * New output fields:
	  * Show all KEY=VALUE pairs from the uio device's uevent sysfs file as device
			attributes (when invoked with the '--verbose' flag). This can help a lot
			in identifying the right uio device to use.
	  * For each mapping, show its offset if non-zero, and its name (which might
		  be the empty string).
	* Several small fixes
