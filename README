lsuio - List UIO devices.

This is a fork of
http://www.osadl.org/projects/downloads/UIO/user/lsuio-0.2.0.tar.gz

It contains some bugfixes and some enhanced functionality. It adds:

- Every attribute in a device's uevents sysfs file is exposed as an individual
  uio_dev_attr_t entry. This is very useful for finding the correct uio
  device.

- For every memory mapping, also expose its name and offset. With the name, we
  have a method for distinguishing multiple mappings without relying on a
  specific order. Offset is a prerequisite for using mappings where the base
  register is not page-aligned.

The original README of this program follows below.
